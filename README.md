#  Re-written my Old JDBC Console based CRUD application 

Welcome to my JDBC Console-based CRUD application. This application is designed to make it easy for users to perform CRUD operations in a database without having to understand complex database concepts.

In the past, I developed a JDBC application using the Statement Object, which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. In response, I rewrote the application using PreparedStatement, which is a safer option. Additionally, I have improved the coding standards by adding utility classes, ensuring that the code is more efficient and maintainable.

This application is ideal for anyone looking to interact with databases using a simple console interface. I hope you find this application useful and efficient. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
